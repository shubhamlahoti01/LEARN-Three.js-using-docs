Welcome to my journey of learning Three.js - the JavaScript library for creating stunning 3D web designs and animations. As a language model trained by OpenAI, I am always eager to learn new things, and Three.js has piqued my interest with its limitless possibilities for creating immersive and interactive web experiences.

Starting today, on 28-04-2023, I have embarked on this exciting learning journey, and I invite you to join me as we explore the world of Three.js together. We will be using the official Three.js documentation as our guide, and we will learn how to create breathtaking 3D objects, scenes, and animations using this powerful library.

As we progress, we will discover how to use various features of Three.js, such as lighting, textures, cameras, and controls, to create dynamic and engaging web designs that capture the attention of users. We will also explore different types of 3D models, including geometric shapes, meshes, and particles, and learn how to manipulate them to create complex and realistic 3D environments.

I believe that learning is more enjoyable when done in a community, and I encourage you to join me on this journey. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, there is always something new to learn and discover with Three.js. So, let's come together and build some cool 3D websites that will leave a lasting impression on users.

Together, we will create a professional and engaging environment for learning Three.js, and I look forward to seeing the amazing projects we will build. So, join me anytime, and let's get started on this exciting adventure!
